So, using common sense let's understand this.
The cut, cut out the fourth phrase in the sentence while using a space as the divider.
I mean, when the thing meets a space it counts the thing before the space as one.
So, "64" is one , "bytes" is two , "from" is three and the ip is four.
I'll be using this to create an ip sweeper in the [[Bash Scripting]] note.
