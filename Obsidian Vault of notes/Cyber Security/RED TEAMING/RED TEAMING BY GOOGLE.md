Red teaming is a security testing methodology in which a team of security experts, or red team, simulates an attack on an organization's systems and networks in order to identify and exploit vulnerabilities (Usually with the use of [[METASPLOIT]] or the likes of it). The goal of red teaming is to improve the organization's security posture by identifying and fixing weaknesses before they can be exploited by real attackers.

Red teaming can be conducted in a variety of ways, depending on the organization's needs and objectives. Some common red teaming techniques include:

- Social engineering: The red team attempts to trick employees into revealing sensitive information or clicking on malicious links.
- Phishing: The red team sends emails or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate source, such as a bank or credit card company. The emails or text messages often contain links that, when clicked, download malware onto the victim's computer.
- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: The red team floods a system or network with traffic, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
- Zero-day attacks: The red team exploits vulnerabilities in software that the organization is not aware of.
