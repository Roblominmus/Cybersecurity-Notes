**Operations plan**

The operations plan is a document that provides specific details about how a red team engagement will be executed. It expands on the CONOPS and resource plan, and it includes information such as:

- Halting/stopping conditions: The conditions under which the engagement will be stopped.
- Required/assigned personnel: The specific personnel who will be involved in the engagement, and their assigned roles and responsibilities.
- Specific TTPs and attacks planned: The specific attack vectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that the red team will use during the engagement.
- Communications plan: How the red team will communicate with each other and with the client during the engagement.
- Rules of Engagement (optional): The rules of engagement (ROE) for the engagement. The ROE define the limits of what the red team is allowed to do during the engagement.
