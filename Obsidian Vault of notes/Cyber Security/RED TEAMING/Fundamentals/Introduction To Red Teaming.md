What is Red Teaming?
	Red teaming is basically like doing an all out attack on an infrastructure, company, it's employees, etc.
	It is just like taking the place of an attacker and doing everything you can to get what you need form the company as a whole.
	Basically like, everything is fair game.

--------------------------------------

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PENETRATION TESTING AND RED TEAMING

|   |   |
|---|---|
| RED TEAMING | PENETRATION TESTING |
|In red teaming, you take the place of a real attacker, you will need to use your resources and techniques to gain access, any means possible, you will need to find ways to avoid detection, social engineering and other stuff to just gain anything useful.  | In penetration testing, you will be told the thing you will be attacking and the scope you will be using |
|It goes on longer as an APT (Advanced Persistent Threat will most likely be put in place), and it is quieter for the most part | It goes on for a short period of time, and the scope is very small, along side that the pentester does not need to worry about being quiet or loud.|
|The results are more useful for building defenses that for attacks that could actually IRL| The results are just used to patch up any open vulnerabilities|

------------------------

In Red Teaming, a group will take the place of a real attacker and try to get a flag, or crown jewel.
Unlike pentesting, the group does not try to find as many vulnerabilities as possible, this will just make the whole operation stupidly loud.
Instead, they have a specific goal they are meant to get, and they do all the things they need to do in other to find that specific thing (flag).
Be it social engineering, DDOS, Foot printing, physical attacks ( literally, they physically enter the establishment and try to set up something sort of like a connection), or simply all of the above and more, while also remaining undetected.

------------------

Ways A Red Teaming Engagement Is Run:
- **Full Engagement:** Simulate an attacker's full workflow, from initial compromise until final goals have been achieved.
- **Assumed Breach:** Start by assuming the attacker has already gained control over some assets, and try to achieve the goals from there. As an example, the red team could receive access to some user's credentials or even a workstation in the internal network.
- **Table-top Exercise:**Â  An over the table simulation where scenarios are discussed between the red and blue teams to evaluate how they would theoretically respond to certain threats. Ideal for situations where doing live simulations might be complicated.
---------------------
What is Adversary Emulation?
	This when the Red Teamers use the methods and tactics of some some famous attack frameworks to act as if they were the attackers. 
	It is like, using the method a particular group of hackers use to attack your company to see if the company can go against that group.
	The red teamer use the cyber kill chain as a guide to attack the company, while blue teamers use it as a guide to create their defense.
	Many organizations have released their cyber kill chains for training purposes, due to the fact that almost all cyber kill chains bear a resemblance we can know that the real attacker will not stary too far from the released methodologies / cyber kill chains.
	Right now I am learning with the [[Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain]].
	The Lockheed Martin kill chain focuses on a perimeter or external breach. Unlike other kill chains, it does not provide an in-depth breakdown of internal movement. You can think of this kill chain as a summary of all behaviors and operations present.
	As in the kill chain is more about getting the general idea of wat is happening in the organization, it is not in depth.
	You can check the components of the kill chain in the [[Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain]] page. In the full pic.
