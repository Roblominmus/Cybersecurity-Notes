Metasploit is a software used for discovering and taking advantage of exploits.
It is also one of the [[INTRODUCTION]] tools used in cybersecurity for penetration testing and [[Introduction To Red Teaming]].
It is the world's most used pen-testing and exploitation framework.
Metasploit is used after scanning a network (Usually with [[NMAP]]) and figuring out the devices available on that network and their vulnerabilities.

In order to start the Metasploit command line you first of all have to start its gresql database using the command "service postgresql start"

After that you then use the command "sudo msfconsole" to start up the metasploit commandline.

**COMMANDS**
	-help : This is honestly the best command in Metasploit, it shows you the stuff you can do and how to do it.
	=====================================================================
	-search (exploit): This returns info about the exploit you specified.
		The modules are the first things you will see in the directory after the search.
		This is the usual layout of a module in Metasploit
		module/operating-system or function-of-the-module/service/vulnerability-name
		You could use different modules , one of them is an auxiliary module which just helps get more info on the IP specified, but the module's function is dependent on the function.

After finding the exploits you wish to use, you could simply [[run the exploits or auxiliary]].
Don't forget to set an RHOST.
In the case that the exploit fails you could try to change the payload, or just use a whole new exploit.

Look at the [[POST EXPLOITATION]] note to see the notes I have about what happens after exploitation.
