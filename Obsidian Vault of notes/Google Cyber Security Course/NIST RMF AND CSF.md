The **NIST Risk Management Framework** has seven core functions:

1. **Prepare**: Activities to manage security risks before they occur, like monitoring for risks and identifying control measures.

2. **Categorize**: Developing processes considering how information confidentiality, integrity, and availability might be affected by risks.

3. **Select**: Choosing and documenting controls to protect the organization and managing documentation for efficient issue resolution.

4. **Implement**: Putting security and privacy plans into action to minimize ongoing security risks.

5. **Assess**: Evaluating if established controls are implemented correctly and identifying potential weaknesses.

6. **Authorize**: Taking responsibility for security and privacy risks within the organization, often involving generating reports and establishing action plans.

7. **Monitor**: Being vigilant about how systems operate and making necessary changes to minimize risks and align with security goals.

The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) framework is a vital tool for managing cybersecurity risk. 
It stands for the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, a voluntary framework consisting of standards, guidelines, and best practices. 
The framework is made up of five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.

These functions help organizations manage risks, implement risk management strategies, and learn from past mistakes. "Identify" focuses on managing cybersecurity risks and their impact on people and assets. "Protect" involves implementing policies, procedures, training, and tools to mitigate threats. "Detect" aims to identify potential security incidents and improve monitoring capabilities. "Respond" focuses on containing and neutralizing security incidents. "Recover" involves returning affected systems to normal operation after an incident. The NIST framework is an essential toolfor organizations to develop plans and handle incidents effectively, ultimately improving their security posture.

The NIST framework is a tool developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology to aid organizations in managing and enhancing their cybersecurity efforts. It's comprised of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. "Identify" involves understanding and managing cybersecurity risks. "Protect" focuses on implementing safeguards for assets and data. "Detect" entails continuous monitoring to identify potential cybersecurity incidents. "Respond" involves taking action to contain and mitigate the impact of incidents. Lastly, "Recover" emphasizes restoring services and processes to a secure state after an incident. This framework helps organizations bolster their cybersecurity strategy and resilience against evolving cyber threats.
